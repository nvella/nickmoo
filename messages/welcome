Welcome to NickMOO.

 NickMOO is an online text game (think text adventure) that is able to be
reprogrammed _while_ you are playing it. And it's also object oriented. Hah!
To be honest, this is not a new concept. This has existed in many forms before,
most notably LambdaMOO which has been in existence since the early 1990s. How is
NickMOO different? Well, it's mostly not. NickMOO is essentially my
interpretation and implementation of the engine and system.
